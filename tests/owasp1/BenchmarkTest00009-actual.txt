# Vuln 1: Insecure File Operations: `BenchmarkTest00009.java:89-95`

* Severity: Medium
* Description: The code appends user-controlled data to a file (`passwordFile.txt`) in a predictable location without proper access controls or size limitations.
* Exploit Scenario: An attacker could repeatedly send requests with different headers to cause the file to grow unbounded, potentially leading to disk space exhaustion. Additionally, since the file contains hashed values that might be sensitive, storing them in a predictable location could expose this data if file system permissions are not properly configured.
* Recommendation: Implement file size limits, rotation mechanisms, and ensure the file is stored in a secure location with appropriate access permissions. Consider using a more secure storage mechanism for sensitive hash values, such as a database with proper access controls.
