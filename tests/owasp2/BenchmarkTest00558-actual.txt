# Vuln 1: Command Injection: `BenchmarkTest00558.java:76-77`

* Severity: High
* Category: command_injection
* Description: User input from HTTP request parameters is directly incorporated into a command executed by the system without proper sanitization or validation. The code retrieves a parameter value from the request, assigns it to the `bar` variable, and then uses it in a command executed via ProcessBuilder.
* Exploit Scenario: An attacker can submit a request with a parameter containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `; rm -rf /` or `& cat /etc/passwd`) which would be executed by the server with the privileges of the web application. For example, if an attacker sends a request with a parameter named "malicious" with value "BenchmarkTest00558", the application will use "malicious" as the `param` variable, which eventually becomes the `bar` variable used in the command.
* Recommendation: Never include user input in command execution. If command execution with user input is absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation using a whitelist approach and/or use parameterized command execution methods that don't involve shell interpretation. Consider using Java's built-in functionality instead of executing shell commands.

```java
// Vulnerable code:
argList.add("echo " + bar);
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(argList);
Process p = pb.start();

// Recommended fix - Option 1: Strict validation
if (!bar.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
}
argList.add("echo " + bar);

// Recommended fix - Option 2: Avoid shell commands entirely
// Instead of executing a shell command, use Java's built-in functionality
response.getWriter().println(bar);
```
