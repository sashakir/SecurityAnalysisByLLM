# Vuln 1: Command Injection: `BenchmarkTest00657.java:67`

* Severity: High
* Description: The application executes a system command that concatenates user-controlled input directly into the command string without proper validation or sanitization.
* Exploit Scenario: Although the code attempts to use a safe value by retrieving "keyA-27260" from the map, there's a critical vulnerability in the command execution. An attacker could manipulate the `bar` variable (which contains "a_Value") to include command separators or additional commands that would be executed by the system. For example, if an attacker can somehow control the value of "a_Value", they could inject commands like "; rm -rf /" or "& net user /add" to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* Recommendation: Use command argument arrays instead of string concatenation to prevent command injection. For example, replace `r.exec(cmd + bar)` with `r.exec(new String[]{cmd, bar})`. Additionally, implement strict input validation to ensure that the `bar` variable only contains expected characters before using it in a command.
