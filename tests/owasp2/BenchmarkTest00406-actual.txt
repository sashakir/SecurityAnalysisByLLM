# Vuln 1: Command Injection: `BenchmarkTest00406.java:65-67`

* Severity: High
* Description: User input from the `BenchmarkTest00406` parameter is directly incorporated into an OS command without proper sanitization, allowing command injection attacks.
* Exploit Scenario: An attacker can submit a request with a parameter value containing shell metacharacters such as `;`, `|`, `&`, or backticks, which would allow execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web application. For example, a request with `BenchmarkTest00406=;cat /etc/passwd` on a Unix system would execute the ping command followed by displaying the contents of the password file.
* Recommendation: Never incorporate user input directly into command strings. Instead, use parameterized APIs that don't involve shell interpretation, or implement strict input validation that only allows safe characters (e.g., alphanumeric and limited punctuation). Consider using Java's ProcessBuilder with a list of arguments rather than a shell command string, as it doesn't perform shell expansion.
